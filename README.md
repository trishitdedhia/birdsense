Have you ever witnessed the tragedy of pigeons infiltrating your balcony; then covering the entire place with their poop; even the rear side of the window that you will have to pull off a "mission impossible" stunt to clean?  Well, pigeons have gone way beyond being just a tiny problem; they have become a nuisance! Pigeons exist in almost every urban area, especially cities! And it's unfortunate that people buy expensive apartments in a city such as Mumbai: only to later cover its grand balconies with a shabby pigeon net. Well, there hasn't much of a choice given the situation. At least not until now.
